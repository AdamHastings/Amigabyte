So this is what a .mod file has

Up to 31 sample instruments, which are played back at different speeds

4 tracks/channels, which read from each instrument

Each note is an instrument at a note with an effect applied. Some of
these effects define the song

A collection of patterns, which are usualy 0x40 = 64 beats long

A list that orders the patterns to make the song.


So, this means

It's not as incremental or self-similar as we think unless we make it
so

We won't know what an instrument or channel is doing what unless we
recognize that
